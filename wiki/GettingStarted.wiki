#How to get started using this script.

= Getting Started =

Assuming you have downloaded the Juniper VPN software, have the necessary JRE, have converted the ncui.so into an executable, and obtained the SSL certificate for your company's login page, you're ready to begin using this script.  If you have not yet done these things, look first at the [http://mad-scientist.us/juniper.html Mad Scientist's page] and next at [http://makefile.com/.plan/2009/10/27/juniper-vpn-64-bit-linux-an-unsolved-mystery sdeming's page].


= Downloading =

Download the script following the instructions on the download page.  Feel free to make it executable (chmod +x junipervpn.py) and place it in your PATH.

= First Execution =

The first time you run it, use the '-c' or '--create' switch to create a configuration file.  It will prompt for user information such as your user name, your SecurID token, the URL of the page you would normally login into in order to retrieve your DSID cookie, etc.  You may optionally store your password in the configuration file. 

= Normal Execution =

After you have a valid configuration file, simply execute the script:
{{{
./junipervpn.py
}}}

If you have not elected to store your password in the configuration file, you will be first prompted for that information.  Next, you will be prompted for your SecurID token.  At this point, your VPN connection will be initiated.
